This website is intended to provide assistance in setting up and using a computer or notebook. We want to give tips on how the operating system or individual programs can be configured for better readability and thus for greater user-friendliness.
 
Please note, the website with the current articles has moved to

    https://computer-und-sehen.de

You will learn how to set up Linux, macOS and Windows and how to improve readability with system settings and accessibility features of the operating system, as well as how to get support using screenreader or VoiceOver.

The articles are published in German language.
